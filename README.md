### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Imanisima/Imanisima** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

🔭 I’m currently working on Memo Hacha, a notetaking app for language learners.

🌱 I’m currently learning React and Firebase.

🐳  I finally learned Docker.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project geared towards making the language learning process easier.

⚡ Fun fact: I don't like Sweet Tea or Coconut.
